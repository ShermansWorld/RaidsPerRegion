RaidsPerRegion is a server event plugin addon that utilizes MythicMobs. It allows you to start a raid on a WorldGuard region or Towny town. When a raid is started your custom MythicMobs mobs start spawning in the specified region. The players in the region must kill a set number of mobs before the timer runs out in order to win the raid. There are three tiers of raids.
